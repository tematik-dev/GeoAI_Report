> ***Update v.1*** <br>
> Adding reports of GeoAI-Parcel Shape Classification and Tree Species Detection models to the repo

A Collection of reports obtained from testing Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) by the AI Research Team to ensure quality and transparency to the public. Reports include:
- Background/Description
- Model architecture in general
- Metric
- Sample output
- Short explanation (eg: unique cases, advantage/disadvantage, etc)

<br>

### Deployed Models
Deployed models are models being used currently by the team to produce the desired thematic maps
| Model | Version | Task |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| [Parcel Shape Classification] | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v.3-red) | Classifying land parcel shape |
| [Tree Species Detection] | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v.1-red) | Detecting tree species in land parcel |

<br>

### Models in Development
Models in development represent models being developed and not ready to be deployed before passing testing phase
- Settlement
- LULC Change
- Green Space
- Bulding Floor Coefficient

<br>

Any GeoAI models are subject to change. Models may differ slightly or entirely from previous versions depending on the needs of ATR/BPN. Please stay updated through this page if you plan to use ATR/BPN thematic data.
