### Background / Description
This deep learning model serves the purpose of classifying land parcel shapes based on vector data. Its primary objective is to inform users and consumers about the shape of a desired land parcel. The model categorizes parcels into the following shape types: Irregular, L-shaped, Rectangular, Round, Square, Trapezoid, and Triangular. The practical applications of this classification extend to various stakeholders. For instance:
- Property developers often prefer square or rectangular shapes because of its convenience in calculating area.
- Government entities may prioritize triangular or round parcels for park development in order to increase green open space area and because of the lack of interest by public to develop in those shapes.
- Warehouse managers might find L-shaped parcels suitable for their needs because heavy vehicle can get in from on end - ----.

### Deployed Models
Deployed models are models being used currently by the team to produce the desired thematic maps
| Model | Version | Task |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| [Parcel Shape Classification] | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v.3-red) | Classifying land parcel shape |
| [Tree Species Detection] | ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-v.1-red) | Detecting tree species in land parcel |

### Models in Development
Models in development represent models being developed and not ready to be deployed before passing testing phase
- Settlement
- LULC Change
- Green Space
- Bulding Floor Coefficient

Any GeoAI models are subject to change. Models may differ slightly or entirely from previous versions depending on the needs of ATR/BPN. Please stay updated through this page if you plan to use ATR/BPN thematic data.
